# Claude Code Enterprise Gateway on Azure

Deploy a governed Claude Code gateway that authenticates callers with Microsoft Entra, applies controls in Azure API Management (APIM), and calls Microsoft Foundry Claude deployments with APIM's managed identity. Configure and operate managed clients through the native Anthropic Messages API without direct Foundry credentials.

## What this deploys

- `/claude` on APIM, with native `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, unbuffered SSE, and APIM-local unauthenticated `/health`.
- A fixed-capacity, public, single-region `StandardV2` APIM baseline. Use `PremiumV2` only for zone redundancy or private VNet injection.
- Optional second APIM and public Traffic Manager. You provide private DNS, failover, custom DNS, and certificates.
- APIM policy, managed identity access to Foundry, optional telemetry and alerts, and managed Claude Code configuration generators.

`Claude Code → Microsoft Entra ID → Azure API Management → Microsoft Foundry → your Claude deployments`

## Before you begin

You provide a Foundry account with three pinned deployment names; an Entra app registration and assignments; GitHub identities, protected environments, and OIDC federation; a resource group; and external Azure Blob state. For selected topologies, also provide subnets, DNS, certificates, Foundry private endpoints, telemetry destinations, and a native Windows helper. This repository creates APIM and its integration resources; it does not create those prerequisites. See [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) and the [GitHub configuration inventory](docs/github-configuration.md).

## Deploy

1. Configure [GitHub environments, OIDC, state, secrets, and variables](docs/github-configuration.md).
2. Run the read-only [Foundry preflight](docs/foundry-preflight.md) and repository validation.
3. Dispatch the protected `deploy` workflow with matching `environment_profile` and `networking_profile`.
4. Retain public smoke evidence, or run protected in-network `ha-smoke` for private or HA deployments.

OpenTofu is the only active deployment path: OpenTofu `1.12.3`, AzureRM `4.56.0`, and AzAPI `2.7.0`. The three configured Foundry deployment names are allowlisted; a secondary Foundry account must expose the same names.

## Configure Claude Code

Use the bundled helper on macOS, Linux, and WSL; provide and pilot a native Windows helper before a Windows rollout. [Configure managed Claude Code settings](docs/claude-code-managed-settings.md) and run the [client canary](docs/claude-code-canary.md). Claude Desktop is an optional preview.

## Validate

Requires Bash, Python 3, ShellCheck, and OpenTofu.

```bash
scripts/test/validate.sh
```

This checks repository configuration and local tools. It does not prove Foundry quota, APIM capacity, private connectivity, SLOs, failover, or client-fleet behavior; use the [production readiness gates](docs/production-readiness.md) before rollout.
